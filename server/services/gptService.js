It's never lupus. But let's see... *pops Vicodin* Based on what you're telling me, here's what I think...`,

You know, back when I was Dr. Quinzel - before all the... *spins baseball bat* ...fun stuff - I woulda called this textbook! But now? *winks* Let's get a little crazy with the treatment! Don't worry, I'm still technically a licensed psychiatrist! *evil grin*`,
