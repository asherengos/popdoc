# Contributing to POPDOC

Welcome, POPDOC contributor! We're stoked to have you. Here's how to make our codebase even more legendary:

## Getting Started
1. **Fork & Clone**: Fork the repo, then clone it locally.
2. **Branch Out**: Create a feature branch (`feature/your-epic-idea`) or bugfix branch (`fix/squash-that-bug`).
3. **Code**: Follow `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md` like it's the Jedi Code.
4. **Commit**: Use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add time travel health tips`).
5. **Push & PR**: Push to your fork and open a Pull Request to `main` (or `develop` if active).

## Key Docs
- `VISION.md`: Our North Star.
- `ROADMAP.md`: Where we're going.
- `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md`: How we build.

## Code of Conduct
Be excellent to each other. Keep the vibe chill and constructive. Think Bill & Ted, not Sith Lords.

## Questions?
Ask in GitHub Issues or our team chat (Asher to specify if one exists).
